# LLM-Detecting-AI-Generated-Text-with-Tiny-Bert

# Goal
The goal of this notebook is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether a given text is generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) or written by a human. The project aims to use a lightweight, efficient model (TinyBERT) to tackle the AI-generated text detection problem using a public dataset.

# Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Data Science Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

- Machine Learning Libraries:
  - scikit-learn (for data splitting and metrics)
  - PyTorch (for model training, data handling, and saving)
  - Transformers Library: HuggingFace Transformers (for TinyBERT, tokenization, and model loading)
- Dataset: LLM Detect AI Generated Text Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/llm-detect-ai-generated-text-dataset )

# Conclusion 
After training and evaluating the model on a stratified and sampled dataset, the model achieved strong results:

- Precision, recall, and F1-scores for both human- and AI-generated text are around 0.92â€“0.94.
- The overall accuracy on the validation set is 93%.
  
This demonstrates that TinyBERT, when properly fine-tuned, is capable of distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text with high accuracy. The project also includes saving the full trained model for future use.
